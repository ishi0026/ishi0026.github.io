        <aside>
            I am from Japan. Before I came to Canada, I had been working in the university. I am really interested in educational field.
            When I was a university student, I did internship in prep school for high school students. I supported them to find way to study and sometimes taught them English.
            Also, I majored “Body Expression and Cinematic Arts”, it was kind of art field. I acted, took photos, wrote scripts and shoot video. 
            After graduation, I forgot all about being creative, but I am happy to try again with this program.
            I am nervous about this new challenge, but I will do my best based on the principle of <q>doing what looks interesting to me</q>.

            My hobbies include listening to music. I am a big fan of <em>The Beatles</em>. This is because I played their song in music band club when I was a high school student. 
            In addition, my mother also likes them. The Beatles songs are able to hear in Canada, so when I listen them, it reminds me of my younger day’s memory.
            Also, I like to read books. Recently, I am reading “The Culture Map”. It is about the difference working place culture around the world.
