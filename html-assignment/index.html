                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                I am from Japan. Before I came to Canada, I had been working in the university as an admin staff. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I have worked passionately in the education industry for a long time.
                </p>
                <p>
                When I was a university student, I did internship in prep school for high school students which called <abbr title="Waseda Prep School">WPS</abbr>.
                </p>
                <p>
                supported them to find way to study and sometimes taught them English.
                </p>
                <p>
                Also, I majored “Body Expression and Cinematic Arts”, it was kind of art field. I acted, took photos, wrote scripts and shoot video. 
                </p>
                <p>
                After graduation, I almost forgot all about being creative, but I am happy to try again with this program.
                </p>
                <p>
                I am nervous about this new challenge, but I will do my best based on the principle of this,
                </p>

                My hobbies include listening to music. I am a big fan of <em>The Beatles</em>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                This is because I played their song in music band club when I was a high school student. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I bought a guitar on my 15<sup>th</sup> birthday. But I couldn't play it very well.
                </p>
                <p>
                In addition, my mother also likes them. The Beatles songs are able to hear in Canada, so when I listen them, it reminds me of my younger day’s memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                Also, I like to read books. Recently, I am reading “The Culture Map”. It is about the difference working place culture around the world.
